# C Code Commenting Standards

All comments in C code must be written in English.

## Comment Guidelines:

- Use English for all comments, documentation, and variable names
- Write clear, descriptive comments that explain the purpose and functionality
- Use Doxygen-style comments for function documentation
- Avoid Portuguese or other languages in code comments

## Examples:

```c
// Good - English comment
/**
 * Creates a new queue instance
 * @return Pointer to new queue or NULL on error
 */
Queue *queue_create(void);

// Bad - Portuguese comment
// Cria uma nova inst√¢ncia da fila
```
